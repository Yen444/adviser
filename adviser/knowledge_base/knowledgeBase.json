The pieces can be uneven, but aim for as uniform of thickness as possible. See the video for full instructions!\nSoak in cold water (10 minutes)\nPlace the cut fries into a medium bowl and rinse with cold water until water is clear. Then fill the bowl with cold water and allow to rest for 10 minutes (while the oven preheats). Then drain the potatoes and dry them thoroughly with a clean dish towel.\nSeason the fries\nAdd the fries to a dry bowl and toss them with the olive oil, Greek seasoning and kosher salt. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Spread the fries in straight lines on the paper, placing them as far apart as possible.\nBake the fries for 20 minutes. Take them out of the oven and carefully flip each fry. Return to oven (reversing the pans on top and bottom racks). Bake additional 8 to 10 minutes until they are crisp and golden brown, watching carefully as the bake time depends on the fry thickness and your oven.

If your pan is large enough to span multiple burners on your stovetop, adjust the heat on each burner so you achieve a steady medium simmer.

Save the hard \u201cshell\u201d of the squash to use for serving, or you can use a 9 x 9 baking dish. Allow the squash to steam in sink for 5 minutes.\nSeason the noodles\nPlace the noodles in a large bowl. Mix in 1 teaspoon kosher salt, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and the Italian seasoning. Add the cheese mixture and stir gently to combine (don\u2019t overmix). Now for the important part: taste the noodles and add up to 1/2 teaspoon more salt, until the flavor pops. The exact amount will depend on the weight of your squash and the brand of ricotta. We typically end up adding between 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon more.\nLayer the lasagna\nUsing the 4 squash shells or a 9 x 9 baking dish, do the following: place a layer of the cheesy squash and top it with a layer of 1 cup sauce (split among the shells if desired). Then top with the final layer of cheesy squash and the remaining 1 1/2 cups sauce. Sprinkle the top with 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese and the remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese (split across the 4 shells or in the pan).\nBake\nPlace in the oven and bake 10 to 12 minutes until cheese is melted. Top with torn or chopped fresh basil.",

If not, add a few pinches of kosher salt and cumin. If you\u2019re using our Homemade Refried Beans, they\u2019ll be perfectly seasoned and you can skip this step.\nIn a large bowl, mix together the green onion, refried beans, salsa, chili powder, and shredded cheese.\nOptional step: If you\u2019re using 100% corn tortillas, you may want to pan fry each one in a skillet with a drizzle of olive oil (or without in a dry pan) to prevent cracking and help them be easier to work with. Every tortilla brand is different, so if your tortillas seem brittle it\u2019s helpful to heat them before rolling. You can do this with corn tortillas too!\nLay a tortilla on a work surface. Spoon about 2 tablespoons of the bean mixture in a dollop onto the bottom half of the tortilla. Be careful not to use too much! Tightly roll the tortilla from the bottom (the filling will spread out and hold the tortilla together). Place the flauta seam-side down on the baking sheet. Repeat for the remaining tortillas.\nWhen the flautas are assembled, brush the tops with oil and sprinkle them with a bit of salt. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until crisp and browned. Some of the beans will come out the ends of the rolls, which is expected (enough filling will remain to perfectly flavor them!). Serve with salsa, guacamole, or sour cream. Freezing instructions: Cool the flautas to room temperature, then freeze in a sealed container. To reheat, bake in a 350 degree oven for 10 to 12 minutes, until warmed through.",

The batter will be slightly thick. Do not overmix.\nPour batter evenly into cake pans. Bake for around 25-28 minutes or until the cakes are baked through. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it\u2019s done. Allow cakes to cool in the pans set on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Run a knife around the edges and then remove from pans. Allow cakes to cool completely set on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.\nMake the frosting:\nIn a large bowl using a hand-held mixer or stand mixer fitted with a whisk or paddle attachment, beat the butter and espresso powder together on medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add confectioners\u2019 sugar, cream/milk, vanilla extract, and salt. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds and then switch to high speed and beat for 2 minutes. Taste and beat in more espresso powder to taste if desired. I usually add another 1/4 teaspoon for more flavor. Yields about 4 cups frosting.\nAssemble and decorate:\nIf your cakes are domed on top, very carefully use a large serrated knife to slice a thin layer off the tops to create a flat surface. Discard (or crumble over ice cream!). Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand, cake turntable, or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with about 3/4 cup frosting. I use and recommend an icing spatula to apply the frosting. Top with 2nd cake layer and spread about 3/4 cup frosting on top. Place 3rd layer on top and frost the sides and top with remaining frosting. A bench scraper is helpful to smooth the sides and feel free to pipe any frosting on top\u2013 I used Ateco 849 piping tip to pipe a border around the pictured cake.\nRefrigerate cake for 10-20 minutes before slicing. This helps the cake hold its shape when cutting.\nCover leftover cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.",

Set over medium high heat, whisking often, until the mixture comes to a boil. Remove from heat and add in the butterscotch mixture.\nGradually ladle about a quarter of the hot liquid into the egg yolks, whisking constantly, to temper the eggs.

Crumble a sheet of parchment paper, then place it gently on top of the crust. Fill the dough with pie weights (we used two sets of these), dry beans, or dry rice. Bake for 15 minutes, then carefully remove the parchment and weights and bake an additional 14 to 15 minutes until the bottom is golden brown (note that the timing may vary if you use store-bought pastry dough).

Add the sugar, honey, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt. Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat and cook until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is bubbling, about 2 to 3 minutes.\nThen in a small bowl, combine the cornstarch with 1/4 cup water and whisk until dissolved. Add the cornstarch mixture to the saucepan and cook, stirring constantly while it bubbles, for 2 to 3 minutes until very thick and glossy. The texture at the end should be incredibly sticky and thick (if not, keep cooking). Turn off the heat.

Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.\nRemove the dough from the fridge and cut into shapes with a cookie cutter, rerolling any scraps and cutting more shapes. Transfer the shapes to the prepared baking sheets.\nIf the dough is too warm, freeze for 15 minutes or until firmed again.\nBake for 10 minutes, or until the cookies are set and begin to brown. Be careful not to over-bake. Let the cookies cool for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Baked un-iced sugar cookies can be frozen in an airtight container for up to 1 month.\nFor the border icing:\nIn a small bowl, use a fork to beat together all the ingredients except the food coloring.

Over high heat, bring a large pot of water to a boil (the water should be high enough in the pot to submerge an apple). As the water heats, remove the apple stems from each apple (if you\u2019d prefer) and insert a popsicle stick about 3/4 down into each apple. Once the water has come to a boil, turn off the heat. Submerge each apple for 15-20 seconds while holding onto the popsicle stick. This won\u2019t cook the apples at all, but will remove any wax on the apples and help the caramel adhere to the apples. Place the apples on the baking sheet.\nOnce they're just warm to the touch, thoroughly dry the apples with a paper towel. Store in the fridge until the caramel is ready for dipping.\nMake the caramel:\nIn a medium stainless steel heavy-duty saucepan, combine water, sugar and salt over medium heat. Stir frequently with a whisk until the sugar has dissolved completely. The mixture should begin to boil after 4 minutes or so.\nOnce the mixture has come to a boil, attach a candy thermometer to the pan, making sure it\u2019s not touching the bottom of the pan. Let the mixture simmer without stirring until the syrup has become dark brown in color and the temperature is about 315\u00b0F (8-10 minutes).\nCarefully add the cold heavy cream to the pan. The mixture will begin to pop and bubble at this point. Constantly stir the mixture with a whisk until the caramel reaches 250\u00b0F. This process should take about 7-9 minutes.\nRemove caramel from heat and carefully stir in the vanilla. The mixture will bubble slightly as the vanilla is added. Be careful not to stir too much as this can create air bubbles in the caramel. Carefully transfer the caramel to a heat-resistant bowl. Cool for 5-10 minutes, or until just warm.\nAs the caramel cools, prepare your additional toppings, if using.\nDip the apples:\nHolding the caramel apple stick, quickly dip the cold apples one at a time into the just-warm caramel, tilting the apple as needed to coat all sides of the apple. Let the excess caramel fall off by either swirling the apple around or gently scraping the bottom of the apple against the edge of the bowl. Place apple back on the parchment lined sheet tray to fully set. Repeat with the remaining apples.\nIf you wish to add additional toppings (such as nuts, crushed Oreos, sprinkles, etc.), immediately roll the freshly-dipped apples in the extra toppings after coating in caramel, as the caramel will set quickly. If you\u2019d like to dip your caramel apples in chocolate, allow 10 minutes for the caramel to fully set before dipping in or drizzling with chocolate.\nIf at any point you notice your caramel beginning to thicken (the cold apples cool the caramel quickly), reheat in the microwave for about 10 seconds before dipping the remaining apples.\nAllow caramel apples to fully set. If not enjoying immediately, store the apples wrapped individually in plastic wrap in the fridge. Apples can be stored in the fridge for up to 1 week, tasting just as fresh as the day they were made. Allow to sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes before enjoying.",

Gradually add the flour mixture and continue mixing on low speed until just combined, about 30 seconds. Divide the dough into two disks. Wrap the disks in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 to 3 hours.\nPreheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.\nTake one disc of dough out of the fridge and place it on a floured surface. Using a light touch, roll the dough out until it is slightly less than 1/4-inch thick. Use plenty of flour on the counter and the rolling pin to prevent sticking.

Place excess dough back in the refrigerator and re-roll it after it\u2019s chilled again (after baking the first sheet). Place the cookies on a baking sheet and refrigerate the sheet for 5 minutes.\nTransfer the baking sheet directly to the oven and bake for 11 to 14 minutes, until lightly browned. Cool the cookies for 1 minute on the cookie sheet. Then transfer to a cooling rack.\nRepeat with remaining disc of dough and re-rolled scraps of dough.\nCool the cookies completely, at least 15 minutes. Then sift powdered sugar the cookies with the cutout centers. On the bottom cookies, spread a layer of jam about 1/8\u201d thick (about 2 teaspoons per cookie), not quite to the edges of a cookie. Then very gently press on the top cookie to sandwich the jam.\nRepeat for all cookies to make 30 to 32 sandwiches. Store room temperature with several sheets of parchment paper between the cookies for up to 2 days*, or refrigerated for 2 weeks. You can also freeze for up to 3 months. The cookies taste crispy the first day, and become softer after storage (both delicious, but we prefer the softer version!).",

Stir to combine. Add the water and stir until a raggy dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface.\nKnead the dough by pushing with the base of your palm, then reforming it into a ball. Continue kneading for 8 minutes until the dough feels pillowy and has a smooth, stretchy exterior. If the dough is very sticky, add a small amount of flour while kneading. Resist the urge to add lots of flour. Alternatively: attach the dough hook to a stand mixer and start the mixer on medium-low speed, then allow the mixer to knead for 8 minutes. If the dough is very sticky, you can add a small amount of flour but resist the urge to add lots.\nProof 45 to 60 minutes\nAfter the kneading is finished, form the dough into a ball and return to the bowl. Proof until doubled in size, about 45-60 minutes. Divide dough into two equal pieces. Gently shape each half into a boule (ball shape) by folding the dough under itself. Place each dough into a separate sealed covered container (we use glass pyrex containers with lids), with room for the dough to double in size.\nRefrigerate 2 days\nPlace containers in the refrigerator for 2 days to ferment (this is where all the flavor comes from!).\nDay 3: Shape & Bake (30 minutes active, 2 hours inactive, 40 minutes bake, 20 minutes cool)\nProof 1 hour\nWhen ready to bake, remove the dough from the refrigerator. Place dough onto lightly floured counter and pull ends under dough to form a boule shape (watch video for this and all following steps). Repeat with second dough. Cover with towel and rest 1 hour.\nFold the dough & rest 10 minutes\nAfter an hour, flip the dough over and pull out the left and right ends. Fold the ends into the center of the dough and gently roll into a log. Pinch the seams on the sides. Be careful not to press too hard while rolling to avoid deflating the dough. Repeat with second dough. Cover with a towel and rest for 10 minutes.\nPre-shape the dough & rest 5 minutes\nSprinkle the doughs with flour. Flip the dough and pat it gently into a rectangle. Fold in half and use the heel of your hand to pinch the seam and form a log shape. Flip and repeat the process. Repeat with second dough. Cover with towel and rest 5 minutes.\nShape the dough & proof 45 minutes\nPlace a clean towel on a baking pan and dust it heavily with flour. Starting from the center of the dough, use your hands to roll the dough into a long baguette shape the almost the length of your pan. Make sure to roll your hands all the way past the ends of the dough to create the tapered point. Carefully transfer the dough to the floured towel and tuck it on both sides to provide support. Repeat with second dough. Cover with a towel and proof for 45 minutes.\nPreheat the oven\nMeanwhile, preheat the oven to 475 degrees Fahrenheit. Place a cast iron pan or your thickest baking sheet on the rack just below and off to the other side of oven. You\u2019ll pour water into it later to create steam.\nScore the bread\nAfter proofing, carefully move each dough out of the towel and transfer it directly onto the pan. Ensure the dough is straightened and dust it lightly with flour. Use a sharp knife or lame to score each bread 4 times at a slight diagonal, just overlapping pattern.\nBake at 475 degrees\nPlace the tray in the oven and add steam: cover your hand with a towel and very carefully pour 1 cup of water onto the cast-iron pan or baking sheet, then immediately close the door. Bake 16 minutes and then reduce the oven temperature to 400 degrees.\nBake at 400 degrees\nOpen the oven door and fan it a few times to release moist air. Bake for 23 to 25 minutes until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack at least 20 minutes before serving.\nStorage instructions\nStore at room temperature wrapped in a towel for up to 2 days. To preserve the second loaf, you can freeze it: wrap in foil and place in a plastic bag. Store for several months in the freezer.

Place the dough back in the bowl and cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap or place in a large zip-top bag.\nProof overnight at room temperature, preferably 12 to 16 hours. The dough will rise and double in size, and then collapse. (For example, we like to mix at 9:00 pm and start the baking process at 1:00 pm the next day.)\nAfter the rise, add a small drizzle of olive oil into a 9\u2033 x 13\u2033 metal baking pan and use your hands to spread it across the bottom. With your oiled hands, turn the dough into the baking pan and gently press and stretch the dough so that it is evenly distributed across the pan (take care not to smash all of the air out of the dough). It may take several times of stretching it out to reach the corners. Cover the pan with plastic wrap or a large zip-top bag and rest for 45 minutes.\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit with a pizza stone inside. You can still bake without the pizza stone, but it will yield an airier dough.\nIn a small bowl, stir together the brine ingredients.\nPour the brine over the puffy dough and lightly press your fingers into the dough, all the way across, to dimple the dough. Sprinkle with rosemary leaves.\nBake immediately: place the pan on the pizza stone and bake for 30 to 35 minutes until golden brown on top. Cool completely before cutting. Store up to 3 days in a sealed plastic bag with excess air squeezed out or a sealed container.",
